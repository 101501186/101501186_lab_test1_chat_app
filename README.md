# 101501186_lab_test1_chat_app

# ----- My Project Overview -----
# The app allows users to sign up, log in, join chat rooms, send messages, and chat with other users in real time. Messages are persisted in MongoDB, and the app uses Socket.io for real-time communication.

# The project should run with this url: http://localhost:3000

# Screenshots and steps of app functionality is provided in the pdf attached to submission
# I made a written demo + screenshots explaining how the app works instead of a live demo because of time.

# ----- Final Words -----
# This project was very fun. I love working with front end development so it nice working with both front-end and back-end. It took me a while to figure out how to implement real time chat, but I ended up figuring it out. Other than that, the project ran smoothly and everything worked out.
